Abstract: 
For our topic, we chose to investigate potential biases in Wikipedia. The articles we researched highlight differences in representation, language, and biases across various subjects. From prior research it shows mulitple bias o the platform including political, cultural, gender, and biographical biases. Although Wikipedia tries to remain a neutral website, biases still persist and shape how we receive our information. 

Research Questions: 

What Wikipedia topics show the most variation in language(Politics, history, Science, etc)?


How does language bias affect access to reliable information across the more underrepresented languages? 

How do the editor's demographic shape language bias (language proficiency, geographic location)? Does it shape what is emphasized in the articles?

Methodology: For our methodology, we plan to investigate bias in Wikipedia by utilizing the Wikipedia API to collect articles and summaries from various topics and languages. From there, we will identify and compare the use of biased language manually for now, but in the future, we could hope to use models to help us check for biases.

Research Question 7: 

Do different languages emphasize different categories for the same topic? 

Methodology: 
- Type in a topic you want to research
- Input the number of characters you want to see
- Enter and see the result
- Type in the same topic, but choose a language that has Wikipedia.
- Look at the output of both and compare the answers


Instructions: 
- python3 week7.py 
- Pick any topic 
- Read the output and compare the results 

Results obtained through Program: 
- From the Program you can tell how different any topic is in Japanese or Spanish compared to english
- It is clear that the information is different, and not a direct translation

How we will use the results 
- From the results we can look up any topic and see how the details and word choice differ
