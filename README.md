Abstract: 
For our topic we chose to investigage potential biases in Wikipedia. The articles we researched highlight differences in representation, language, and biases across various subjects. From prior research it shows mulitple bias o the platform including political, cultural, gender, and biographical biases. Although Wikipedia tries to remain a non-biased neutral website, biases still persit and shapes how we receive our information. 

Research Questions: 

What Wikipedia topics show the most variation in language(Politics, history, Science, etc)?


How does language bias affect the access to reliable information across the more underrepresented languages? 

How do the editor's demogrpahic shape language bias (language proficiency, geogrpahic location)? Does it shape what is emphasized in the articles?

Methodology: For our methodology, we will plan to investiate bias in Wikipedia by using the Wikipedia API to collect articles and summaries from different topics and languages. From there we will identify and compare the use of biased language manually for now, but in the future we could hope to use models to help us check for biases.
