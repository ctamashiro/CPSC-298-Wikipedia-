Summary: This article studies political bias in Wikipedia by analyzing over 70,000 U.S. political articles. THe authors find that early articles leaned Democratic, but over time it moved closer to neutrality as new articles with different leanings were added.
Method: The authors used a statistical method for detecting partisan language. By matching phrases in Wikipedia articles to those used by Democratic or Republican members of Congress, they measured whether an article leaned left or right. They then tracked how this bias has changed after many edits over time.

Significance: This article examines Wikipedia's ability to reach a Neutral Point of View.

Summary: This article uses a machine learning approach to identify biased sentences within wikipedia articles. The authors trained a model through these articles to detect bias-related words.
Method: The authors model combined a bias-word lexicon with semantic features to detect biased language at the sentence level. They validated their approach by evaluating the classifiers on labeled test data, and showed with strong accuracy the model could distinguish biased statements from neutral statements.

Significance: The study found that a notable amount of bias still exists at the sentence level in Wikipedia articles.
